        <h3>What is Cards Against Humanity?</h3>
        <p>Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people. Unlike most of the party games you've played before, Cards Against Humanity is as despicable and awkward as you and your friends.</p>
        <p>The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card.</p>
